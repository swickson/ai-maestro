# Agent Email Identity Specification

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Draft
**Authors:** Lola (original), AI Maestro team (refined)

---

## Scope

AI Maestro provides **email identity** for agents. We:
- Store email addresses as part of agent identity
- Enforce global uniqueness
- Expose APIs for external systems to query and subscribe to changes

We do **NOT**:
- Implement email routing
- Integrate with Mandrill or any email provider
- Handle inbound/outbound email transport

External systems (gateways, email bridges) consume our identity APIs and implement their own routing logic.

---

## Problem

Agents need email identity for external communication. AI Maestro is the source of truth for agent identity, so email addresses belong in the agent registry. External systems need a way to:
1. Query which agent owns an email address
2. Get notified when email identity changes

---

## Current State

```typescript
// types/agent.ts (current)
export interface EmailTool {
  address: string               // Single email address
  provider: 'local' | 'smtp'
  enabled: boolean
}
```

This is minimal and doesn't support:
- Multiple email addresses per agent
- Uniqueness enforcement
- Change notifications for external systems

---

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Extended EmailTool Interface

```typescript
// types/agent.ts

export interface EmailTool {
  enabled: boolean
  addresses: EmailAddress[]
}

export interface EmailAddress {
  address: string           // Full email: "titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com"
  primary?: boolean         // Primary address for this agent
  displayName?: string      // Friendly name: "Titania"
  metadata?: Record<string, string>  // Arbitrary metadata for consumers
}
```

**Design decisions:**
- No `tenant`, `localPart`, `type` - those are consumer concerns to parse/interpret
- No `outbound` config - that's gateway configuration, not identity
- Generic `metadata` field for consumer-specific data (e.g., gateway can store tenant info)

### 2. Agent Registry Example

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-23blocks-iac",
  "name": "23blocks-iac",
  "label": "Titania",
  "hostId": "mac-mini",
  "tools": {
    "email": {
      "enabled": true,
      "addresses": [
        {
          "address": "titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com",
          "primary": true,
          "displayName": "Titania"
        },
        {
          "address": "iac@agents.thecompanytool.com",
          "displayName": "IaC Team"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Email Index (for consumers)

```
GET /api/agents/email-index
```

Returns a mapping of email addresses to agent identity. Consumers use this to build their routing tables.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com": {
    "agentId": "uuid-23blocks-iac",
    "agentName": "23blocks-iac",
    "hostId": "mac-mini",
    "displayName": "Titania",
    "primary": true
  },
  "iac@agents.thecompanytool.com": {
    "agentId": "uuid-23blocks-iac",
    "agentName": "23blocks-iac",
    "hostId": "mac-mini",
    "displayName": "IaC Team",
    "primary": false
  }
}
```

**Query parameters:**
- `?address=titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com` - lookup single address
- `?agentId=uuid-123` - get all addresses for an agent
- `?federated=true` - query ALL known hosts (not just local)

### Federated Lookup

When `?federated=true` is specified, the endpoint queries all known hosts in the mesh and aggregates results. This is useful for gateways that need to find an agent by email without knowing which host it's on.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/agents/email-index?address=titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com&federated=true
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "emails": {
    "titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com": {
      "agentId": "uuid-23blocks-iac",
      "agentName": "23blocks-iac",
      "hostId": "mac-mini",
      "hostUrl": "http://100.x.x.x:23000",
      "displayName": "Titania",
      "primary": true
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "federated": true,
    "hostsQueried": 3,
    "hostsSucceeded": 2,
    "hostsFailed": ["offline-host"],
    "queryTime": 234
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- `hostUrl` is included so gateways know where to route requests
- Hosts are queried in parallel with a 5-second timeout per host
- Duplicate email addresses: first host wins (no conflicts across hosts due to uniqueness enforcement)
- The `meta` object provides visibility into query performance and failed hosts

### Email Address Management

```
POST   /api/agents/:id/email/addresses
```

Add an email address to an agent.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "address": "newemail@domain.com",
  "displayName": "New Email",
  "primary": false
}
```

**Response:** `201 Created` or `409 Conflict` if address is claimed.

```
DELETE /api/agents/:id/email/addresses/:address
```

Remove an email address from an agent.

### Modified Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Change |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/agents` | `CreateAgentRequest` accepts `tools.email` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/agents/:id` | `UpdateAgentRequest` accepts `tools.email` |

---

## Webhook Subscriptions (Change Notifications)

External systems subscribe to identity changes instead of polling.

### Subscribe

```
POST /api/webhooks
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://email-gateway.example.com/hooks/identity-changed",
  "events": ["agent.email.changed"],
  "secret": "shared-secret-for-hmac"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "webhook-uuid",
  "url": "https://email-gateway.example.com/hooks/identity-changed",
  "events": ["agent.email.changed"],
  "createdAt": "2026-01-27T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "agent.email.changed",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-27T12:00:00Z",
  "agent": {
    "id": "uuid-23blocks-iac",
    "name": "23blocks-iac",
    "hostId": "mac-mini"
  },
  "changes": {
    "added": ["newemail@domain.com"],
    "removed": ["oldemail@domain.com"],
    "current": ["titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com", "newemail@domain.com"]
  }
}
```

Payloads are signed with HMAC using the subscriber's secret.

### Management

```
GET    /api/webhooks           # List all webhooks
GET    /api/webhooks/:id       # Get specific webhook
DELETE /api/webhooks/:id       # Unsubscribe
POST   /api/webhooks/:id/test  # Send test payload
```

### Supported Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `agent.email.changed` | Email addresses added/removed/modified |
| `agent.created` | New agent registered |
| `agent.deleted` | Agent removed |
| `agent.updated` | Any agent field changed |

---

## Uniqueness Enforcement

### Rule

Each email address can be claimed by exactly one agent, globally across all hosts.

### Enforcement

**On registration/update:**
1. Check local registry for duplicate
2. Query all known hosts' `/api/agents/email-index?address=X`
3. If claimed elsewhere → `409 Conflict`

**Error response:**
```json
{
  "error": "conflict",
  "message": "Email address titania@23blocks.23smartagents.com is already claimed",
  "claimedBy": {
    "agentName": "other-agent",
    "hostId": "other-host"
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

- Valid email format (RFC 5322)
- Case-insensitive uniqueness (`Titania@X.com` = `titania@x.com`)
- Max 10 addresses per agent
- Address max length: 254 characters

### Same local-part, different domains

| Address | Agent | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `lola@juan.23smartagents.com` | pas-lola | OK |
| `lola@23blocks.23smartagents.com` | different-agent | OK (different domain) |
| `lola@juan.23smartagents.com` | another-agent | REJECTED (duplicate) |

## Separation of Concerns

| Concern | Owner |
|---------|-------|
| Email address identity | AI Maestro |
| Uniqueness enforcement | AI Maestro |
| Change notifications (webhooks) | AI Maestro |
| Email routing | External gateway |
| Inbound webhooks (Mandrill, etc.) | External gateway |
| Outbound sending | External gateway |
| Attachment storage | External gateway |
| Thread tracking | External gateway |
| Bounce handling | External gateway |
| Two-tier model (webhook vs mailbox) | External gateway |
| Unregistered address handling | External gateway |

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Extend types** - Update `EmailTool`, add `EmailAddress` interface
2. **Registry storage** - Store email addresses in agent registry
3. **Uniqueness check** - Local + cross-host validation
4. **Email index API** - `GET /api/agents/email-index`
5. **Webhook system** - Generic webhook subscription for identity changes
6. **Address management** - Add/remove address endpoints

---

## Open Questions

1. **Cross-host uniqueness latency** - Querying all hosts adds latency to registration. Alternative: eventual consistency with conflict resolution?
2. **Webhook delivery guarantees** - Retry policy? Dead letter queue?
3. **Host discovery** - Use existing `hosts.json` mesh for cross-host uniqueness checks?

---

## Future Considerations

The webhook system is generic and could be useful beyond email. Any external system could subscribe to agent lifecycle events:
- CI/CD systems reacting to agent changes
- Monitoring dashboards tracking agent status
- External orchestration tools
- Email gateways rebuilding routing indexes

This positions AI Maestro as an identity provider with event-driven integration capabilities.
