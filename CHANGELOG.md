# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Maestro are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.25.9] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Terminal overlapping text** — PTY was spawning at hardcoded 80×24 while browser terminal was wider, causing history/output to render at wrong width. Client now passes `cols`/`rows` via WebSocket URL query params so PTY spawns at correct dimensions. WebSocket connection deferred until terminal is initialized.

## [0.25.8] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **`/plan` mode rendering** — Added `@xterm/addon-unicode11` for proper wide character and emoji width calculation in TUI layouts. Without this, box-drawing characters and emoji caused corrupted layouts in Claude Code's `/plan` mode (#279)
- Send immediate resize on WebSocket connect so PTY/tmux starts at correct size

## [0.25.7] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Podman dev container** — `Containerfile` and `.containerignore` for running tests, lint, and builds in a reproducible container environment. Six `container:*` scripts in package.json (#296)

## [0.25.6] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **AMP case sensitivity** — Agent name lookups in `.index.json`, server routing, and CLI scripts (`amp-helper.sh`, `amp-fetch.sh`) now normalize to lowercase. Fixes message delivery failures when agent names have mixed case (#298)

## [0.25.5] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Soft-deleted agents reappearing** — `listAgents()` now filters out agents with `deletedAt` (#292)
- **Wake returns 410 Gone** for soft-deleted agents instead of generic 404 (#294)
- **AMP cleanup on soft-delete** — Removes UUID directory and index entry when agent is soft-deleted (#295)

## [0.25.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Mac Mini WebGL crash** — Recover from WebGL context loss by re-opening terminal element to force canvas renderer fallback. Wraps `scrollToBottom`/`focus` in try-catch to prevent crash when renderer is undefined (#278, #290)

## [0.25.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **DJB2 hash consolidation** — Single `djb2Hash()` in `lib/utils.ts` replacing 3 duplicate implementations (#282)
- **Tablet navigation** — Layout toggle and nav button fixes for tablet dashboard (#280)
- **Pin onnxruntime-node** to 1.17.0 via resolutions to prevent build failures (#233)

## [0.25.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **CozoDB query injection** — Parameterized all CozoScript queries to prevent injection via agent names (#286)
- **Deduplicate graph aliases** — Prevent duplicate alias rows in agent graph (#284)
- **Debounce subconscious indexing** — Prevent concurrent indexing runs (#283)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **WSL2/NAT agent connectivity** — `isSelf` flag + `getAgentBaseUrl()` helper so dashboard works when browser and server are on different networks (#273-#277)
- **jq compatibility** — Restructured array concatenation in `install-agent-cli.sh` for older jq versions (#268, #272)
- **TerminalView ResizeObserver** — Replaced 20×150ms polling loop with ResizeObserver for terminal container dimension detection (#278)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- Plugin rebuilt with AMP standard compliance
- Agent Skills standard compliance for all 6 skills (#264)
- Integrated community contributions (#256, #258, #260, #261)
- Reverted premature onnxruntime-node downgrade and ConversationSource abstraction (#263)

### Fixed
- PM2 ecosystem config references (`ecosystem.config.cjs` → `.js`) (#269, #271)
- RCE command injection in tmux session management (v0.24.18)

## [0.24.17] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Startup self-diagnostics** — `services/diagnostics-service.ts` runs checks on server start and logs a clear pass/fail/warn summary to console
- **`GET /api/diagnostics` endpoint** — On-demand system health report checking tmux, node-pty, agent registry, Node.js version, disk space, and remote host reachability
- Remote host diagnostics cascade — local startup checks each remote host's `/api/diagnostics` (or `/api/v1/health` fallback) to surface broken hosts (e.g., tmux unavailable on a remote)
- Pre-flight tmux check in `scripts/start-with-ssh.sh` — warns if tmux is missing before starting the server
- Headless router entry for `/api/diagnostics`

## [0.24.13] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Toast notification system** — Lightweight toast system (`ToastContext`, `Toast`, `ToastContainer`) using Framer Motion + createPortal with auto-dismiss, progress bar, and max 5 stacking
- **SecretRevealDialog** — Modal for webhook secrets with show/hide toggle (Eye/EyeOff) and copy-to-clipboard feedback
- **Providers wrapper** — Client-side `Providers.tsx` keeps `layout.tsx` as a server component

### Changed
- Replaced all 11 `alert()` calls across 5 files with contextual toast notifications
- Network error toasts now hint at connectivity issues ("The agent host may be unreachable")
- ForwardDialog uses inline validation error instead of browser alert
- WebhooksSection shows secret in a proper modal dialog instead of alert

### Removed
- All browser `alert()` usage eliminated from the codebase

## [0.24.12] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Brain inbox** — JSONL-based signal queue (`brain-inbox.ts`) allowing cerebellum and subconscious to surface signals to the cortex via the idle_prompt hook
- **OpenAI TTS in companion UI** — Provider toggle button and API key input for the OpenAI TTS tier ($15/M chars vs ElevenLabs $206/M)
- **Message event type in cerebellum** — `message` classification with 0ms cooldown for AMP notification detection in terminal output
- Brain inbox API endpoint (`/api/agents/[id]/brain-inbox`) + headless route
- Subconscious memory surfacing — after indexing, searches for relevant memories and writes to brain inbox

### Changed
- Hook refactored to single agent lookup (`findAgentByCwd`) shared across all check functions, eliminating 3 redundant `/api/agents` calls per idle_prompt
- Hook sends combined notification (messages + brain signals) as a single prompt to avoid race conditions
- Plugin submodule updated for Anthropic skill compliance

### Fixed
- Plugin builder security hardening, accessibility, and reliability improvements

## [0.24.11] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Plugin Builder page** (`/plugin-builder`) — Visual skill composition interface for building Claude Code plugins
- Plugin builder service layer with manifest generation, build execution, and repo scanning
- API routes: build, build status, scan-repo, push-to-github
- Two-column UI: skill picker (left) + plugin composer (right)
- Plugin Builder marketing page (`docs/plugin-builder.html`) with SEO and Schema.org markup
- **Agent roles** — `AgentRole` type (`manager` | `chief-of-staff` | `member`) added to Agent and AgentSummary
- **Team types** — `TeamType` (`open` | `closed`) and `chiefOfStaffId` added to Team type (foundation for AMP routing policy)

## [0.24.10] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- Plugin submodule updated: `aimaestro-agent.sh` CLI split into 6 focused modules (agent-core, agent-commands, agent-session, agent-skill, agent-plugin + thin dispatcher)

## [0.24.9] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **OpenClaw agents as first-class citizens** — Auto-register OpenClaw agents in the agent registry on discovery, enabling AMP messaging, kanban task assignment, and team meeting participation
- Auto-query working directory from OpenClaw tmux sessions via `display-message`
- Auto-initialize AMP home directory and set `AMP_DIR`, `AIM_AGENT_NAME`, `AIM_AGENT_ID` environment variables in OpenClaw tmux sessions
- Session name validation (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`) for OpenClaw-discovered sessions to prevent path traversal

### Changed
- AMP initialization only runs on first agent registration (not every poll cycle)
- Plugin submodule updated: `CLAUDE_AGENT_*` env vars renamed to `AIM_AGENT_*` with backward compatibility fallback
- Plugin README consolidated from root + plugin into single comprehensive document

### Fixed
- CI build: create `data/` directory before touch in workflow

## [0.24.8] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **OpenClaw tmux session discovery** — Detect agents running in OpenClaw's custom tmux sockets at `/tmp/clawdbot-tmux-sockets/`

### Fixed

- Outdated `pm2 start server.mjs` examples in OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md

### Changed
- Made `tsx` a production dependency (was devDependency — `yarn install --production` would break)
- `start-with-ssh.sh` uses direct `./node_modules/.bin/tsx` instead of `npx tsx`

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Service layer architecture** — 23 service files, all ~100 API routes are thin wrappers
- **Headless mode** (`MAESTRO_MODE=headless`) — API-only server, no Next.js, ~1s startup
- Headless router serving all endpoints via standalone HTTP router
- Shared state bridge pattern (`globalThis._sharedState`) for server.mjs/API route interop
- `ServiceResult<T>` return type across all services
- 486 tests (281 service tests + 205 existing)
