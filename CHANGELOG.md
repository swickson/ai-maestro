# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Maestro are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.35.44] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Chat: AskUserQuestion interactive rendering** — Claude Code's multiple-choice questions (AskUserQuestion tool_use) now render as interactive numbered buttons in the chat UI, matching the terminal experience. Users can click options directly instead of typing numbers. Includes "Other" option that focuses the chat input. Buttons disable immediately after selection. Works in both assisted and power modes, desktop and mobile.
- **Chat: live activity indicator from PTY** — Parses real-time PTY output to show what the agent is doing while working. Detects spinner status ("Thinking…", "Reading...", "Searching..."), thinking step progress ([1/418], [2/418]), and tool execution patterns (Running, Writing, Editing). Shows in the chat header (replaces generic "Agent is working...") and as an animated inline bubble at the bottom of the message list. Throttled to 500ms, clears when assistant messages arrive. Works for local agents; remote agents get this with deployment of the same version.

### Fixed
- **Chat: AskUserQuestion messages hidden in assisted mode** — Messages containing only an AskUserQuestion tool_use were incorrectly filtered as "tool-only" messages. Now excluded from tool burst grouping and always visible since they require user interaction.

## [0.35.31] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Chat view empty for agents with underscores in working directory** — Claude Code converts both `/` and `_` to `-` when naming project directories (e.g., `rag_ingestion` → `rag-ingestion`), but our JSONL path resolution only replaced `/`. Any agent with underscores in its path couldn't find its conversation files. Fixed in `server.mjs`, `agents-chat-service.ts`, and `voice-subsystem.ts`.

## [0.35.30] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Terminal resize storm causing content to jump/rewrite** — Multiple independent systems (onOpen, history-complete, ResizeObserver, notes toggle) all triggered `fit()` → resize message → PTY resize → tmux full-screen redraw simultaneously. Now: no resize on connect (PTY spawns at correct size via URL params), no resize on history-complete, resize messages gated until history is loaded, deduplicated by tracking last sent cols/rows. Only real user actions (browser window resize, notes panel toggle) trigger a resize.
- **Tab switching causing terminal re-render** — Switching between Terminal and Chat tabs disconnected/reconnected the WebSocket, causing a full history reload + resize storm on return. WebSocket now stays connected across tab switches.
- **ResizeObserver debounce too short** — Increased from 150ms to 300ms so CSS transitions fully settle before refitting, preventing redundant fit→resize cascades.

### Added
- **Agent scheduling system** — Cron-based task scheduling for agents. Schedules stored in `~/.aimaestro/schedules.json`, checked every 60s by a timer in server.mjs. Supports creating tmux sessions for offline agents and sending prompts via send-keys. API: `GET/POST /api/agents/{id}/schedules`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/agents/{id}/schedules/{scheduleId}`, `GET /api/schedules` (global), `POST /api/schedules/{id}/trigger` (manual/webhook). Execution history tracked per schedule.

## [0.35.28] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Circuit breaker permanently disabling remote hosts** — When a remote host became temporarily unreachable, the circuit breaker tripped after 3 failures and set `enabled: false` in `hosts.json`, permanently disabling the host until manual config editing + server restart. Replaced with a proper half-open circuit breaker pattern: state is now in-memory with exponential backoff (30s → 60s → 120s → 240s → 5min cap). When cooldown expires, the next UI poll probes the host automatically. Success resets everything. `hosts.json` is never modified by the circuit breaker.
- **Reactivate endpoint rejecting circuit-broken hosts** — `/api/hosts/[id]/reactivate` only handled `enabled: false` hosts. Now also handles in-memory circuit-broken hosts (enabled but with open circuit).

### Added
- **Container hardening flags** — Agent Docker containers now launch with `--cap-drop=ALL` (selective `--cap-add` for 6 required capabilities), `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, and `--tmpfs /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m`. Existing containers get these on next `/recreate`.
- **`GET /api/docker/stats`** — New endpoint returning real-time CPU %, memory usage/limit/%, network I/O, and PID count for all running agent containers, mapped to agent IDs.

## [0.35.26] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Chat: hookState/permission prompts not appearing** — The hook's agent resolution used `find()` on `/api/agents` by working directory, which returned the wrong agent when multiple agents share the same cwd. Now uses a 3-tier resolution: (1) `AIM_AGENT_ID`/`AIM_AGENT_NAME` env vars, (2) `/api/sessions` for active tmux sessions, (3) fallback cwd match. Server-side `broadcastActivityUpdate` also tries agentId-based session lookup when the primary sessionName has no chat clients.
- **Chat: messages overflowing viewport** — Long messages broke out of chat bubbles. Added `min-w-0 overflow-hidden` on bubble containers, `max-w-full` on code blocks, and `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on paragraphs.
- **Chat: duplicate pending messages** — Sent message appeared twice (pending + real) because the `hadNew` flag was set inside React's deferred `setMessages` callback and was always false when checked synchronously. Fixed by clearing pending unconditionally on new JSONL data.

## [0.35.24] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Chat: production-grade WebSocket reliability** — Replaced 3s polling hack with proper WebSocket architecture based on production best practices: server-side dead connection sweeping (RFC 6455 protocol ping + `_isAlive` flag), client-side pong verification with 45s timeout and forced reconnect, 15s heartbeat on both desktop and mobile.
- **Chat: permission button clicks not working** — Button actions ("y", "1", etc.) were never clearing from pending because permission responses don't appear as `user` messages in the JSONL. Now clears pending on any genuinely new messages from the JSONL watcher.
- **Chat: partial JSONL line race condition** — `broadcastJsonlUpdates` now handles incomplete lines when Claude is mid-write, preventing silently dropped messages.
- **Chat: auto-scroll tracking** — UUID-based tracking instead of message count (always 200 after server cap).
- **MobileChatView: no heartbeat** — Mobile was missing all keepalive/reconnect logic. Now has 15s heartbeat, pong verification, and same pending/scroll fixes as desktop.

## [0.35.21] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Mesh host cache desync causing lost agents** — The `.mjs` host config module cached hosts forever and filtered disabled hosts at the cache level. When the circuit breaker disabled a host or a host was re-enabled, `server.mjs` never learned about it, causing persistent "Host not found" errors and broken terminal connections for remote agents (e.g., mini-lola).
- **Cross-module cache invalidation** — When the circuit breaker writes to `hosts.json`, both the TypeScript and ESM host config caches are now cleared via a `globalThis` bridge. Previously only the `.ts` cache was invalidated, leaving `server.mjs` with stale data until restart.
- **AMP messages silently routing to disabled hosts** — `message-send.ts` now rejects routing to disabled hosts with a clear error instead of silently timing out.
- **AMP mesh auth trusting disabled hosts** — Disabled forwarding hosts no longer receive automatic authentication trust in `amp-service.ts`.
- **Dead code in websocket-proxy.mjs** — Replaced `host.type === 'local'` (never triggers, property not set in ESM module) with `isSelf(host.id)`.
- **Frontend AbortError cascade** — `useAgents.ts` now skips disabled hosts entirely, preventing timeout-triggered React re-render storms.

### Added
- **TTL cache for host config (30s)** — `hosts-config-server.mjs` re-reads `hosts.json` every 30 seconds instead of caching forever. Hosts re-enabled by sync or manual edit are picked up automatically without server restart.
- **Disabled host visibility in getHostById** — `getHostById()` now finds disabled hosts so callers can give proper error messages ("host is disabled") instead of generic "host not found". `getHosts()` still returns only enabled hosts for backward compatibility.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Call mode session fork** — When a companion voice call starts, the server auto-spawns a temporary `{agentName}__call` tmux session with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (full autonomy). Voice transcripts route to this YOLO fork instead of the primary supervised session, so tool-call permission prompts don't block conversational flow. Same agent identity, workdir, and skills — just a disposable autonomous session.
- **Multi-client call session sharing** — Multiple companion clients connecting to the same agent share a single `__call` session. The session is only killed when the last client disconnects.
- **`user_message` routing to call session** — Typed text from the companion UI now also routes to the `__call` session when active, matching `voice:transcript` behavior.
- **Stale call session cleanup** — Orphaned `__call` tmux sessions from server crashes are automatically killed on startup.
- **`computeCallSessionName()` / `isCallSession()` helpers** — Centralized naming convention (`__call` suffix) in `types/agent.ts`, used across all files.
- **Call session integration test** — `scripts/test-call-session.sh` validates the full lifecycle: spawn, sidebar hiding, orphan prevention, transcript routing, disconnect cleanup, multi-client.
- **12 unit tests for call session** — Covers helpers, `parseSessionName` non-collision, `__call` filtering in both `/api/sessions` and `/api/agents` discovery paths.

### Fixed (v0.35.14)
- **Remote terminal blank screen** — Fixed WebSocket proxy not forwarding `cols`, `rows`, and `socket` query parameters to remote hosts. The remote PTY was spawning at default 80x24 instead of the client's actual terminal dimensions, causing blank or broken terminal rendering. Same fix applied to cloud agent container connections.

### Improved
- **Trust level descriptions** — Each permission mode now shows a clear explanation of what it does (e.g., "Asks before every file edit and shell command") plus a detail blurb when selected explaining when to use it.
- **Permission mode only for Claude Code** — The trust level selector in the Wake Agent dialog is now hidden when waking non-Claude programs (Aider, Codex, Cursor, Terminal), since `--permission-mode` is a Claude Code-only flag.
- **Reordered permission modes** — Plan Only now appears second (after Supervised) instead of last, so the list flows from most restrictive to least restrictive.

### Fixed
- **Command injection risk in companion-ws** — Replaced all `execSync` shell-string tmux commands with `execFileSync`/`execFile` (array args, no shell). Agent names validated against `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` before use.
- **Event loop blocking on transcript delivery** — Transcript routing now uses async `execFile` instead of blocking `execSync`, preventing WebSocket/HTTP stalls during rapid speech.
- **Voice buffer timing race** — Changed `getBuffer()` to `getOrCreateBuffer()` for voice subsystem attachment, ensuring the buffer exists regardless of PTY observer timing.
- **`__call` sessions leaking into agent discovery** — Added `isCallSession()` filter to both `fetchLocalSessions()` (sessions-service) and `discoverLocalSessions()` (agents-core-service). Without this, `__call` sessions would auto-register as orphan agents in the registry.

## [0.35.11] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **voice:transcript upstream handler** — Mobile companion can now send spoken text to agents via `/companion-ws`. Transcripts route through the same `sendChatMessage()` pipeline as typed /chat messages, so session resolution, copy-mode cancellation, and tmux key sending all work identically.
- **voice:interrupt upstream handler** — Mobile companion can send barge-in interrupts to cancel in-progress speech generation. The voice subsystem aborts LLM summarization, clears the terminal buffer, and broadcasts a stop signal to all companion clients.
- **Server-initiated interrupt on web companion** — `useCompanionWebSocket` now handles `{type: 'interrupt'}` messages from the server and calls `tts.stop()`, so the web FaceTime UI stops TTS playback when another client (e.g. mobile) triggers a barge-in.
- **`cancelCurrentSpeech()` on VoiceSubsystem** — New method for barge-in support: aborts summarization, clears buffer, emits `voice:interrupt` downstream.

## [0.35.9] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Favorites / Speed Dial** — Pin frequently-used agents to a horizontal strip at the top of the sidebar for one-click access. Toggle via context menu ("Add to Favorites" / "Remove from Favorites") or star button on hover in list view. Persisted in localStorage.
- **Chat permission prompts** — When an agent requests permission (e.g., to run a Bash command), the full prompt now appears in the chat with the command preview and clickable option buttons (Yes, Yes and don't ask again, No). Previously only visible in the terminal view.
- **Real-time activity indicators in meeting chat** — Meeting chat now shows "Agent is working..." (spinner) and "Agent is waiting for input" (pulse) using WebSocket-backed session activity instead of naive heuristics.

### Changed
- **X-Ray mode** — Renamed Power/Assisted chat mode to "X-Ray". Single `ScanEye` icon toggles on (amber glow) / off (gray) instead of swapping between two different icons.
- **Permission buttons always visible** — Chat permission action buttons now render in both X-Ray on and off modes. Previously gated to assisted-only, leaving no way to respond in power mode.

### Fixed
- **Hook not sending full hookState** — The `ai-maestro-hook.cjs` was writing permission details (toolName, toolInput, options) to a file but only sending `status` via the WebSocket broadcast. Now includes the full `hookState` object in the payload.
- **Headless router missing hookState** — The headless router's activity update endpoint was not forwarding `body.hookState` to `broadcastActivityUpdate`.
- **Bash commands overflow in chat** — Long commands rendered as a single line overflowing off-screen. Now uses `whitespace-pre-wrap` + `break-all` to wrap within the chat bubble.
- **Meeting chat messages behind textarea** — Added `min-h-0` to the messages container for proper flex overflow constraint.
- **No auto-scroll on permission prompt** — Added scroll trigger when `hookState` changes to `permission_request`.

## [0.35.7] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Tool-specific previews in chat** — Collapsed tool headers now show contextual one-line previews: Bash shows the command, Read/Write/Edit show the file path, Grep shows the pattern, Task shows the description. Expanding a tool shows styled content (green mono for Bash, red/green diff for Edit) instead of raw JSON dumps.
- **Collapsible thinking blocks (desktop)** — Thinking blocks render as collapsible purple-tinted cards with 120-char preview. Click to expand/collapse with max-h-64 scroll.
- **Summary dividers** — `compact_boundary` and `microcompact_boundary` system messages now render as centered horizontal-rule dividers instead of being invisible.
- **Power mode / Assisted mode** — The zap/shield toggle now controls chat verbosity. Assisted mode (default) shows only the clean user-agent conversation. Power mode shows the full train of thought: thinking blocks, tool calls, summary dividers.
- **Save to Memory button** — Brain icon on assistant messages opens a popup form to save responses to agent memory with optional instructions (UI only, backend TBD).
- **Tool-result filtering** — JSONL parser now skips invisible `toolUseResult` user messages, effectively doubling the useful message history within the 200-message budget.

### Changed
- **MobileChatView tool badges** — Tool badges now show tool-specific preview text (`Bash ls -la`) instead of generic `Used Bash on ls -la`.

## [0.35.6] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Chat messages not reaching agents** — WebSocket chat handlers in `server.mjs` used `ptyProcess.write()` which bypassed tmux input handling and failed silently when no terminal tab was open (`ptyProcess: null`). Replaced both handlers (chat-only and full-terminal) with `tmux send-keys -l` using proper single-quote escaping and a 100ms delay before Enter, matching the proven `agent-runtime.ts` pattern.

### Added
- **Host circuit breaker** — Automatically disables unreachable remote hosts after 3 consecutive failures in `getUnifiedAgents()`, eliminating 3s timeout delays per dead host on every poll cycle. Configurable via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` env var.
- **`POST /api/hosts/:id/reactivate`** — New endpoint to manually re-enable a circuit-broken host. Also registered in headless router.
- **Mesh self-healing** — `registerPeer()` auto-re-enables circuit-broken hosts when they come back online and re-register.
- **Disabled hosts in `GET /api/hosts`** — `listHosts()` now appends disabled hosts with `status: 'disabled'` so the settings UI can show them with a "Reactivate" button.
- `offlineReason` and `offlineSince` fields on the `Host` type for tracking circuit breaker metadata.
- `loadAllHostsRaw()` and `updateHostRaw()` in `hosts-config.ts` to operate on the unfiltered host list (bypasses `enabled` filtering).
- `lastSyncSuccess` now populated on every successful remote host fetch.

## [0.35.5] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Duplicate agent creation from UUID-based session naming** — When `agentId` was passed to `createSession()`, the tmux session was named `uuid@host` instead of the agent's friendly name, causing session discovery to fail matching and triggering phantom agent creation via AMP. Now always uses the normalized agent name for tmux sessions.
- **Orphan session fallback matching** — Session discovery had no fallback when `getAgentBySession()` failed for legacy UUID-named sessions. Added fallback that extracts UUIDs from `uuid@host` session names and looks up the agent by ID directly.

## [0.35.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Infrastructure type icons** — New `InfraIcon` component displays infrastructure type (Docker, EC2, ECS, Cloud, Standalone) as a small icon next to agent names across all views (sidebar, tablet, mobile). Local agents show no icon to reduce clutter.
- **WebSocket heartbeat** — Client-side ping/pong mechanism (30s interval, 10s timeout) detects dead connections that mobile browsers kill silently without firing close events. Server responds to pings in both terminal and chat-only WebSocket handlers.

### Fixed
- **Mobile WebSocket disconnection** — Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) silently kill WebSocket connections after a few minutes without triggering close events. The new heartbeat mechanism detects dead connections within 40s and triggers reconnection.
- **Chat messages hidden behind input** — Messages went behind the textarea and send button when sending because auto-scroll only triggered on received messages, not pending messages. Fixed in both desktop and mobile chat views.
- **Non-AWS cloud agents mislabeled** — GCP, Azure, and DigitalOcean agents were incorrectly shown with AWS EC2 icon. Added generic "Cloud" infra type for non-AWS providers.
- **Unsafe type cast in deployment detection** — Replaced `(cloud as Record<string, unknown>).runtime` with proper `runtime?: string` field on `AgentDeployment.cloud` interface.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **WebSocket-driven chat** — Replaced 5-second file-polling chat with real-time WebSocket architecture. Chat now shows agent activity (tool use, permissions, thinking) instantly instead of lagging behind the terminal. New `chat:*` protocol multiplexed on the existing `/term` WebSocket via lightweight chat-only connections (`/term?name=X&chatOnly=1`). Server-side JSONL file watcher with incremental reads eliminates client polling. Permission prompts appear within 500ms (was 5s+).
- **Mobile and tablet WebSocket chat** — MobileChatView and TabletDashboard now use the same WebSocket chat architecture. Includes visibility API reconnection on tab switch, pending message bubbles with optimistic UI, hookState options display, and queue-operation message rendering.
- **Cloud deployment (AWS)** — Full AWS cloud deployment support for running agents on EC2 and ECS. EC2 native install with automated user_data bootstrap, ECS auto-build with Dockerfile and Terraform configs, Agent Creation Wizard with cloud deployment options, container image with agent-server.js for remote agent management.
- **Meeting inject queue** — Hybrid dispatch with bracketed paste support for reliable message injection during team meetings.
- **Meeting task CLI** — New `scripts/meeting-task.sh` for managing meeting tasks from the command line.
- **Container utilities** — `lib/container-utils.ts` with comprehensive test suite for Docker and cloud container management.
- **AMP canonical JSON** — `lib/amp-canonical-json.ts` for deterministic JSON serialization in message signing.
- **Cloud API routes** — `agents/cloud/create`, `agents/cloud/[id]/status`, `agents/cloud/[id]/destroy` for cloud agent lifecycle.
- **MarkdownRenderer component** — Dedicated `components/chat/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` for chat message rendering.

### Fixed
- **sendKeys split** — Literal sendKeys + Enter now split into separate calls with 100ms delay, preventing race conditions in tmux input handling.
- **Meeting stability** — Discovery reorder, hook reliability improvements, and meeting chat panel fixes.
- **Hosts logging** — Improved logging for host discovery and connection issues.
- **Avatar strip rendering** — Fixed avatar display in compact views.
- **Hibernate heartbeat** — Fixed heartbeat handling for hibernated agents.
- **Hostname resilience** — Cloud environments with dynamic hostnames now handled gracefully.

### Tests
- 755 tests passing (up from 281). New test suites: container-utils (209 tests), agents-docker-service (1589 tests), meeting-inject-queue (179 tests), meeting-inject-utils (54 tests), amp-canonical-json (103 tests).

## [0.29.9] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **WebSocket connection leak causing exponential reconnects** — `connect()` in `useWebSocket.ts` only bailed on `readyState === OPEN`, not `CONNECTING`. On high-latency connections (remote hosts over Tailscale), calling `connect()` while a socket was still connecting created orphaned WebSockets that leaked server-side. Each orphan's `onclose` handler spawned its own reconnect chain, multiplying exponentially. Observed as 177 simultaneous clients from a single browser tab. Fixed in `useWebSocket`, `useCompanionWebSocket`, and `useSessionActivity` — close non-CLOSED sockets before creating new ones, and guard `onclose` against stale closures.
- **Standalone agents now show online in sidebar** — `AgentBadge` and `AgentList` were only checking `agent.sessions[0].status` (persisted session config), ignoring `agent.session.status` (runtime heartbeat status). Standalone agents with no tmux session always appeared offline despite having a valid heartbeat.
- **Duplicate hibernate + standalone overlay on offline agents** — The standalone/offline early-exit blocks in `page.tsx` rendered as normal flow elements alongside the main renderer's `absolute inset-0` overlay, causing both to be visible simultaneously. Now guarded by `!selectableAgents.some()` so they only render when the main renderer won't handle the agent.
- **Heartbeat TTL increased from 2 to 10 minutes** — Standalone agents send heartbeats on Claude Code hook events (`Stop`, `SessionStart`, etc.), but during long tool executions no events fire. The 2-minute TTL caused agents to flicker offline mid-task.

## [0.29.8] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Terminal content no longer appears "cut off" during active output** — Removed server-side PTY pause/resume backpressure in `server.mjs` that was adding artificial delays between chunks. When tmux redraws the screen (cursor/clear sequences followed by content), these delays made intermediate "cleared" states visible. xterm.js already batches writes via `requestAnimationFrame`, so chunks now flow at their natural rate and render atomically within a single frame.
- **Synchronized Output passthrough for tmux** — Updated `scripts/setup-tmux.sh` to set `default-terminal` to `tmux-256color` (was `screen-256color`) and added `terminal-features` with `sync` flag. This enables DEC mode 2026 (Synchronized Output) passthrough so xterm.js can defer rendering until the end-of-update sequence, making screen redraws truly atomic. Both tmux 3.6a and xterm.js 6.0.0 support this — it just wasn't configured.

## [0.29.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Standalone agents now visible in dashboard sidebar** — The sidebar uses `/api/agents` (agents-core-service), not `/api/sessions`. Heartbeat data was only integrated into the sessions endpoint. Now `listAgents()` checks the `agentActivity` heartbeat map so standalone agents show as online with `session.standalone: true`.
- **Heartbeat ID resolution** — The heartbeat function now resolves agent identifiers by both UUID and name, fixing a mismatch where heartbeats stored under the agent name couldn't be found by UUID lookup in `listAgents()`.
- **Standalone agent terminal view** — Clicking a standalone agent no longer attempts a WebSocket/tmux connection. The dashboard shows a "Standalone Agent" placeholder explaining the agent runs outside tmux. This applies whether the agent is online (recent heartbeat) or offline (expired heartbeat).
- **Persistent standalone flag** — Agents with no tmux sessions and no cloud deployment are marked `standalone: true` even when offline, preventing the "Start Session" prompt for agents that were never meant to have a terminal.

## [0.29.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Standalone agent presence** — Agents that run outside of tmux (plain terminal, API-only, remote hosts) can now appear live in the dashboard via a heartbeat mechanism. New `POST /api/agents/:id/heartbeat` endpoint lets any agent announce itself periodically. The dashboard discovers standalone agents alongside tmux sessions, Docker containers, and cloud deployments. Agents with a recent heartbeat (< 2 min) show in the sidebar; stale heartbeats auto-expire.
- **Hook-based heartbeat for Claude Code** — The AI Maestro hook now sends a heartbeat on every event (SessionStart, Stop, Notification), so Claude Code sessions automatically register their presence even when running outside tmux. The hook also sends `agentId` alongside `sessionName` in status broadcasts for more precise activity tracking.
- **`agentActivity` shared state** — New in-memory Map tracking standalone agent heartbeat timestamps, shared between server.mjs and API routes via the existing globalThis bridge pattern.
- **Client-side activity by agentId** — The `useSessionActivity` hook now indexes activity updates by both `sessionName` and `agentId`, and `getSessionActivity()` accepts an optional `agentId` parameter for standalone agent lookups.
- **`standalone` flag on Session type** — Sessions discovered via heartbeat carry `standalone: true` so the UI can distinguish them from tmux/Docker/cloud sessions.

### Fixed
- **Hook directory matching bug** — Removed `agentWd.startsWith(cwd + '/')` from all 3 hook copies. This condition caused a parent directory agent to incorrectly match when running from any child directory (e.g., agent in `/project` would match cwd `/project-tools`). Only exact matches and "cwd is inside agent's directory" now count.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Push notifications now wake Claude reliably** — Real-time AMP inbox notifications previously required the operator to manually click Enter in each agent's terminal before the agent would process the message. Root cause: the tmux `send-keys -l '<text>' \; send-keys C-m` chain delivered the text and the Enter in the same tmux tick, so Claude Code's input handler could receive the submit in the same batch as the text — before the input field had updated — and lose the submit. `lib/notification-service.ts` now splits the text and the Enter into two separate `send-keys` calls with a 150ms shell-level delay between them, so agents process inbound messages without operator intervention.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Unified API error format** — All API error responses across the codebase now follow the AMP protocol format: `{ error: 'code', message: 'Human text', field?, details? }`. One consistent shape for all 106 route handlers. (#285, #327 — thanks @mvillmow for the original report)
- **`services/service-errors.ts`** — Single source of truth for `ServiceResult<T>`, `ServiceError`, and `ServiceErrorCode` (30 codes: AMP's 18 + 12 generic). Ships 20+ factory functions (`missingField`, `notFound`, `operationFailed`, `alreadyExists`, `gone`, `invalidState`, etc.) and validation helpers (`requireString`, `requireArray`, `requireNameFormat`).
- **`app/api/_helpers.ts`** — `toResponse()` turns any `ServiceResult` into a `NextResponse` with consistent error formatting.

### Changed
- **25 service files** migrated to shared `ServiceResult` and factories (~305 error returns standardized).
- **88 route files** converted to thin wrappers: `return toResponse(result)`.
- **25 component files** updated to read `data.message || data.error` for backward-compatible error display.
- **5 test files** updated (49 assertions now match structured `ServiceError` shape).
- **`lib/types/amp.ts`** refactored: `AMPErrorCode` is now `Extract<ServiceErrorCode, ...>`, `AMPError extends ServiceError`. `AMPNameTakenError` interface corrected to match runtime shape (`details.suggestions`).
- **`services/headless-router.ts`** — `sendServiceResult()` mirrors `toResponse()` for headless mode.
- Net change: **154 files, +1,365 / −1,977 = −612 lines** despite adding the new foundation.

### Fixed
- `preconditionFailed()` factory now returns **412** (was 400).
- `lookupAgentByName` and `lookupAgentByDirectoryName` catch blocks now propagate real errors via `operationFailed()` instead of silently swallowing failures.
- `toResponse()` defensive fallback preserves caller's 4xx status instead of always overriding to 500.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Multi-agent hook support** — AMP inbox notifications now work across Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. Hook script auto-detects which AI agent is calling it and returns the correct response format (`additionalContext` for Claude, `systemMessage` for Codex/Gemini; normalizes Gemini's `AfterAgent` → `Stop`). Installer auto-detects installed agents and writes hook configs for each, enabling `codex_hooks = true` in Codex's `config.toml`. (#324)
- **Claude Code `additionalContext` for inbox notifications** — Replaced broken tmux `send-keys` notification with Claude Code's native `additionalContext` hook response. Agents now receive inbox notifications as system reminders injected into their conversation context instead of having text typed into their TUI input field. Added standalone fallback via `amp-inbox.sh --count` so notifications still work when AI Maestro is down. (#321, #322, #323)

### Changed
- Removed `sendMessageNotification()` (broken tmux send-keys approach) in favor of hook-based `additionalContext` injection.

## [0.26.6] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **macOS hostname drift in mesh identity** — `isSelf()` now checks cached aliases so machines retain mesh identity after the OS hostname changes. Two-pass lookup (hostname first, then IP alias with exactly-one-match guard) prevents DHCP false positives from claiming remote hosts as self. (#318, #320)

## [0.26.5] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Auto-install Claude Code status line** — `install-plugin.sh` now configures the AMP status line automatically, showing agent identity and unread message count in Claude Code's footer. Idempotent and reversible via `amp-statusline.sh --uninstall`.

## [0.26.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **AMP mesh routing restored** — `amp-send.sh` was incorrectly using filesystem delivery for remote agents after message migration created local directories. Now checks for `config.json` to distinguish real local agents from migration-created inbox directories (upstream PR #15).
- **AMP fetch URL fix** — `amp-fetch.sh` was missing `/v1/` prefix on fetch and acknowledge endpoints, causing 404s against external providers like Crabmail (upstream PR #14).
- **AMP message ID timestamps** — `generate_message_id()` now uses seconds-precision timestamps per AMP spec (was milliseconds) (upstream PR #14).

## [0.26.3] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **AID v0.2.0 — fully independent from AMP** — Agent Identity no longer requires AMP to be installed. New commands: `aid-init` (standalone identity init), `aid-helper` (self-contained helper with OpenSSL auto-detection, Ed25519 signing). All `aid-*` scripts now source `aid-helper.sh` instead of `amp-helper.sh`. If both AMP and AID are installed, they share `~/.agent-messaging/agents/` — one Ed25519 identity serves both protocols. Plugin now ships 50 scripts (was 48).

## [0.26.1] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **Renamed `install-messaging.sh` → `install-plugin.sh`** — The installer now reflects its actual scope: all skills, scripts, and CLI tools (not just messaging). Added plugin builder references (repo + website) to the script header and banner. Updated all references across docs, CI, and helper scripts.
- **Auto-discover skills in installer** — Replaced hardcoded skill list with dynamic discovery from the plugin directory. New skills added via the manifest build are automatically installed without modifying the installer.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Agent Identity (AID) integration** — Added `agentmessaging/agent-identity` as a new source in the ai-maestro plugin manifest. AID provides passwordless OAuth 2.0 authentication for AI agents using their AMP Ed25519 cryptographic identity — no passwords, no API keys, no secrets to rotate. New commands: `aid-register`, `aid-status`, `aid-token`. New skill: `agent-identity`. Plugin now ships 7 skills and 48 scripts.

## [0.25.16] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Sync AMP plugin scripts to v0.1.3** — Ran `build-plugin.sh --clean` on `ai-maestro-plugins` to pull latest AMP scripts from upstream via the manifest build system. Includes key rotation proof-of-possession, local fingerprint uniqueness guard, `--id` parameter, client-side UUIDv4, and multiple security fixes.

## [0.25.15] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Key rotation with proof-of-possession** — `POST /api/v1/auth/rotate-keys` now accepts an optional body with `new_public_key`, `key_algorithm`, and `proof` fields. When provided, the server verifies the proof (new key signed with old private key) before accepting the rotation. Omitting the body falls back to server-side key generation for backward compatibility.
- **Duplicate public key rejection** — `POST /api/v1/register` now rejects registration when the submitted public key fingerprint is already associated with a different agent (409 `key_already_registered`). Same-agent re-registration with the same key remains allowed.

## [0.25.14] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`POST /api/v1/messages/pending/ack`** — Spec-correct path for batch message acknowledgment. Accepts `{ "ids": [...] }` body. The old `POST /api/v1/messages/pending` path is kept as a backward-compatible alias.
- **`GET /api/v1/agents/me/card`** — Returns a signed agent card containing the agent's address, public key, fingerprint, provider, and capabilities. The card is Ed25519-signed for verification by peers.
- **`GET /api/v1/messages`** — Alias for `GET /api/v1/messages/pending`. Some AMP clients use the shorter path to fetch pending messages. Both routes now work identically.

## [0.25.12] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Client-provided `agent_id` in AMP registration** — `POST /api/v1/register` now accepts an optional `agent_id` field. If a valid UUIDv4 is provided, the server uses it as the agent's canonical identifier instead of generating one. Supports offline-first agent initialization.

## [0.25.11] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **AMP inbox name→UUID resolution** — `registerAgent()` now calls `initAgentAMPHome()` so `.index.json` maps agent names to UUIDs. Previously, server wrote messages to UUID-based directories but CLI tools resolved via name-based paths, causing delivered messages to be invisible to `amp-inbox.sh`.

## [0.25.10] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`DELETE /api/v1/messages/pending/:id`** — Path-param route for acknowledging pending relay messages. Both `DELETE /pending/:id` and `DELETE /pending?id=X` are now supported for client compatibility.

## [0.25.9] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Terminal overlapping text** — PTY was spawning at hardcoded 80×24 while browser terminal was wider, causing history/output to render at wrong width. Client now passes `cols`/`rows` via WebSocket URL query params so PTY spawns at correct dimensions. WebSocket connection deferred until terminal is initialized.

## [0.25.8] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **`/plan` mode rendering** — Added `@xterm/addon-unicode11` for proper wide character and emoji width calculation in TUI layouts. Without this, box-drawing characters and emoji caused corrupted layouts in Claude Code's `/plan` mode (#279)
- Send immediate resize on WebSocket connect so PTY/tmux starts at correct size

## [0.25.7] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Podman dev container** — `Containerfile` and `.containerignore` for running tests, lint, and builds in a reproducible container environment. Six `container:*` scripts in package.json (#296)

## [0.25.6] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **AMP case sensitivity** — Agent name lookups in `.index.json`, server routing, and CLI scripts (`amp-helper.sh`, `amp-fetch.sh`) now normalize to lowercase. Fixes message delivery failures when agent names have mixed case (#298)

## [0.25.5] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Soft-deleted agents reappearing** — `listAgents()` now filters out agents with `deletedAt` (#292)
- **Wake returns 410 Gone** for soft-deleted agents instead of generic 404 (#294)
- **AMP cleanup on soft-delete** — Removes UUID directory and index entry when agent is soft-deleted (#295)

## [0.25.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Mac Mini WebGL crash** — Recover from WebGL context loss by re-opening terminal element to force canvas renderer fallback. Wraps `scrollToBottom`/`focus` in try-catch to prevent crash when renderer is undefined (#278, #290)

## [0.25.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **DJB2 hash consolidation** — Single `djb2Hash()` in `lib/utils.ts` replacing 3 duplicate implementations (#282)
- **Tablet navigation** — Layout toggle and nav button fixes for tablet dashboard (#280)
- **Pin onnxruntime-node** to 1.17.0 via resolutions to prevent build failures (#233)

## [0.25.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **CozoDB query injection** — Parameterized all CozoScript queries to prevent injection via agent names (#286)
- **Deduplicate graph aliases** — Prevent duplicate alias rows in agent graph (#284)
- **Debounce subconscious indexing** — Prevent concurrent indexing runs (#283)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **WSL2/NAT agent connectivity** — `isSelf` flag + `getAgentBaseUrl()` helper so dashboard works when browser and server are on different networks (#273-#277)
- **jq compatibility** — Restructured array concatenation in `install-agent-cli.sh` for older jq versions (#268, #272)
- **TerminalView ResizeObserver** — Replaced 20×150ms polling loop with ResizeObserver for terminal container dimension detection (#278)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- Plugin rebuilt with AMP standard compliance
- Agent Skills standard compliance for all 6 skills (#264)
- Integrated community contributions (#256, #258, #260, #261)
- Reverted premature onnxruntime-node downgrade and ConversationSource abstraction (#263)

### Fixed
- PM2 ecosystem config references (`ecosystem.config.cjs` → `.js`) (#269, #271)
- RCE command injection in tmux session management (v0.24.18)

## [0.24.17] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Startup self-diagnostics** — `services/diagnostics-service.ts` runs checks on server start and logs a clear pass/fail/warn summary to console
- **`GET /api/diagnostics` endpoint** — On-demand system health report checking tmux, node-pty, agent registry, Node.js version, disk space, and remote host reachability
- Remote host diagnostics cascade — local startup checks each remote host's `/api/diagnostics` (or `/api/v1/health` fallback) to surface broken hosts (e.g., tmux unavailable on a remote)
- Pre-flight tmux check in `scripts/start-with-ssh.sh` — warns if tmux is missing before starting the server
- Headless router entry for `/api/diagnostics`

## [0.24.13] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Toast notification system** — Lightweight toast system (`ToastContext`, `Toast`, `ToastContainer`) using Framer Motion + createPortal with auto-dismiss, progress bar, and max 5 stacking
- **SecretRevealDialog** — Modal for webhook secrets with show/hide toggle (Eye/EyeOff) and copy-to-clipboard feedback
- **Providers wrapper** — Client-side `Providers.tsx` keeps `layout.tsx` as a server component

### Changed
- Replaced all 11 `alert()` calls across 5 files with contextual toast notifications
- Network error toasts now hint at connectivity issues ("The agent host may be unreachable")
- ForwardDialog uses inline validation error instead of browser alert
- WebhooksSection shows secret in a proper modal dialog instead of alert

### Removed
- All browser `alert()` usage eliminated from the codebase

## [0.24.12] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Brain inbox** — JSONL-based signal queue (`brain-inbox.ts`) allowing cerebellum and subconscious to surface signals to the cortex via the idle_prompt hook
- **OpenAI TTS in companion UI** — Provider toggle button and API key input for the OpenAI TTS tier ($15/M chars vs ElevenLabs $206/M)
- **Message event type in cerebellum** — `message` classification with 0ms cooldown for AMP notification detection in terminal output
- Brain inbox API endpoint (`/api/agents/[id]/brain-inbox`) + headless route
- Subconscious memory surfacing — after indexing, searches for relevant memories and writes to brain inbox

### Changed
- Hook refactored to single agent lookup (`findAgentByCwd`) shared across all check functions, eliminating 3 redundant `/api/agents` calls per idle_prompt
- Hook sends combined notification (messages + brain signals) as a single prompt to avoid race conditions
- Plugin submodule updated for Anthropic skill compliance

### Fixed
- Plugin builder security hardening, accessibility, and reliability improvements

## [0.24.11] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Plugin Builder page** (`/plugin-builder`) — Visual skill composition interface for building Claude Code plugins

- Two-column UI: skill picker (left) + plugin composer (right)
- Plugin Builder marketing page (`docs/plugin-builder.html`) with SEO and Schema.org markup
- **Agent roles** — `AgentRole` type (`manager` | `chief-of-staff` | `member`) added to Agent and AgentSummary
- **Team types** — `TeamType` (`open` | `closed`) and `chiefOfStaffId` added to Team type (foundation for AMP routing policy)

## [0.24.10] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- Plugin submodule updated: `aimaestro-agent.sh` CLI split into 6 focused modules (agent-core, agent-commands, agent-session, agent-skill, agent-plugin + thin dispatcher)

## [0.24.9] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **OpenClaw agents as first-class citizens** — Auto-register OpenClaw agents in the agent registry on discovery, enabling AMP messaging, kanban task assignment, and team meeting participation
- Auto-query working directory from OpenClaw tmux sessions via `display-message`
- Auto-initialize AMP home directory and set `AMP_DIR`, `AIM_AGENT_NAME`, `AIM_AGENT_ID` environment variables in OpenClaw tmux sessions
- Session name validation (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`) for OpenClaw-discovered sessions to prevent path traversal

### Changed
- AMP initialization only runs on first agent registration (not every poll cycle)
- Plugin submodule updated: `CLAUDE_AGENT_*` env vars renamed to `AIM_AGENT_*` with backward compatibility fallback
- Plugin README consolidated from root + plugin into single comprehensive document

### Fixed

- `start-with-ssh.sh` uses direct `./node_modules/.bin/tsx` instead of `npx tsx`

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Service layer architecture** — 23 service files, all ~100 API routes are thin wrappers
- **Headless mode** (`MAESTRO_MODE=headless`) — API-only server, no Next.js, ~1s startup
- Headless router serving all endpoints via standalone HTTP router
- Shared state bridge pattern (`globalThis._sharedState`) for server.mjs/API route interop
- `ServiceResult<T>` return type across all services
