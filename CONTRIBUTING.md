## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs

**Before submitting a bug report:**
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Test with the latest version
- Gather relevant information (OS version, Node version, error messages)

**Bug report should include:**
- Clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Environment details (macOS version, Node version, tmux version)

### 2. Suggesting Features

**Feature requests should include:**
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and benefits
- Potential implementation approach
- Why it fits with the project goals

**Note:** Please check the roadmap in README.md first!

### 3. Pull Requests

**Before submitting a PR:**
- Discuss major changes in an issue first
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
- Follow the coding standards below

**PR Requirements:**
- Clear description of changes
- Reference related issue(s)
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure the code runs without errors
- Follow existing code style

**PR Process:**
1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to get AI Maestro running for testing your changes:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro/main/scripts/remote-install.sh | sh
```

This automatically installs prerequisites, clones, and builds the project.

### Fork-Based Development

For making contributions:

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-maestro.git
cd ai-maestro

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Test your changes at http://localhost:23000
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types (no `any` unless absolutely necessary)
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types from `types/` directory

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface SessionListProps {
  sessions: Session[]
  onSessionSelect: (id: string) => void
}

export default function SessionList({ sessions, onSessionSelect }: SessionListProps) {
  // Component logic
}

// ❌ Avoid
export default function SessionList(props: any) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### File Organization

- Place components in `components/`
- Place hooks in `hooks/`
- Place utilities in `lib/`
- Place types in `types/`
- One component per file

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** PascalCase for components (`SessionList.tsx`)
- **Files:** camelCase for utilities (`websocket.ts`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (`sessionId`, `isConnected`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Types/Interfaces:** PascalCase (`Session`, `WebSocketMessage`)

### Git Commits

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
feat: add session export functionality
fix: resolve WebSocket reconnection issue
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: improve color palette organization
style: format SessionList component
test: add tests for useWebSocket hook
chore: update dependencies
```
